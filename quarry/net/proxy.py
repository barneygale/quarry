# Rough diagram of the universe a quarry proxy usually operates in:
#               .
# outside world . server box
#               .
#  +--------+   .   +--------------------------------+       +--------+
#  | mojang | ----> |              QUARRY            | ----> | mojang |
#  | client | <---- | downstream | bridge | upstream | <---- | server |
#  +--------+   .   +--------------------------------+       +--------+
#               .          ^                   ^
#               .        server              client
#               .
#
# A quarry proxy has three main parts:
#  * The "downstream" (a server) which connects with the mojang client
#  * The "upstream" (a client) which connects with the mojang server
#  * The "bridge", which handles packet-passing between the above
#
# The downstream and upstream are broken down into two parts:
#  * DownstreamFactory - program-wide object that spawns a Downtime object for
#      each incoming connection
#  * Downstream - connection with the external client.
#  * UpstreamFactory - a simple class that spawns an Upstream
#  * Upstream - connection with the external server.
#
# When the user connects, the DownstreamFactory creates a Downstream object
#   to communicate with the external client. If we're running in online-mode,
#   we go through auth with mojang. Once the user is authed, we spawn
#   a Bridge object, which in turn spawns a UpstreamFactory. When the
#   connection is made external server, an Upstream object tells the Bridge
#   to enable "pass-through" mode. At this point, the Upstream and Downstream
#   are connected and exchange packets.
#
# You can inspect, drop, modify and forge packets in-transit by registering
#   handlers in the Bridge.
